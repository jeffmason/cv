    	<h3>Philosophy of Teaching/Learning</h3>
    		<p>Teaching has been my chosen profession beginning my second year of college, 1975. I remain enthusiastic and committed to the education of students and to the belief that all students can learn and contribute and that students, engaged in making personally meaningful, authentic high quality products within a social context, are more likely to learn and be motivated to learn. I have been most inspired by the recent advances in Instructional Technology and its potential for developing life-long learning skills.
